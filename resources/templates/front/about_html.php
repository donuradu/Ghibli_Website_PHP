                        <p id="about-p1">Studio Ghibli Inc. is a Japanese animation film studio headquartered in Tokyo, Japan. The studio is best known for its animated feature films, but they have also produced several short films. It was founded on the in 1985 by directors Hayao Miyazaki, Isao Takahata, and producer Toshio Suzuki, after the success of Topcraft's animated film Nausica√§ of the Valley of the Wind (1984). Ghibli's films have been some of Japan's highest grossing films, with Spirited Away (2001) being their most successful film up to date. Five of Ghibli's films have received Academy Award nominations. Totoro, a character from My Neighbor Totoro, who is also displayed here on the right, is the studio's mascot.</p>

                        <p id="about-p2">Ghibli's style is unlike most popular animation film companies'. That's because one of Ghibli's major assets is their "immersive realism" approach to their films. Although parents being turned into pigs, warriors raised by wolves and flying castles are not what we most commonly associate with "realism," it is Miyazaki's ability to create meticulously written stories that feel real because of their similarities to themes of the real world. The works of Miyazaki can be enjoyed across multiple age brackets and hemispheres as is shown by their sucess in the last few decades.</p>
